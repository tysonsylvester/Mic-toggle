# MicToggle

MicToggle is a script that enables users to toggle the mute state of their microphone using a predefined hotkey combination (`Left Windows + Shift + M`). It utilizes AutoHotkey scripting language along with NirCmd, a command-line utility, and Text-to-Speech functionality to provide a convenient solution for muting and unmuting the microphone.

## Key Features:
- **Toggle Microphone Mute**: Users can toggle the mute state of their microphone by pressing the predefined hotkey combination.
- **Text-to-Speech Feedback**: Provides audible feedback to the user by announcing the current microphone state (muted or unmuted) using Text-to-Speech functionality.

## Usage:
1. **Download and Installation**:
   - Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
   - Download the script file (`MicToggle.ahk`) from the repository.
   - Ensure NirCmd (`nircmd.exe`) is located in the same directory as the script.
2. **Run the Script**: Double-click the `MicToggle.ahk` file to run the script. The script will start running in the background.
3. **Toggle Microphone Mute**: Press the predefined hotkey combination (`Left Windows + Shift + M`) to toggle the microphone mute state.
4. **Audio Feedback**: The script will audibly announce the current microphone state.

## Notes:
- Customization: By default, the script uses the hotkey combination `Left Windows + Shift + M` to toggle the microphone mute state. Users interested in customizing the hotkey combination can manually modify the script (`MicToggle.ahk`) to change the hotkey definition.
- Ensure NirCmd (`nircmd.exe`) is present in the same directory as the script for proper functionality.
