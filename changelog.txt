# Change Log for Microphone Toggle Script

## Version 1.0 - Initial Release
- **Initial Script**: 
  - Created a basic AutoHotkey (AHK) script to toggle the microphone mute status using `nircmd.exe`.
  - Implemented TTS announcements using PowerShell to indicate the microphone status ("Microphone is muted" or "Microphone is unmuted").

## Version 1.1 - String Concatenation Fix
- **Fixed String Concatenation**:
  - Corrected the string concatenation in the PowerShell command to ensure proper TTS announcements.
  - Ensured the status message was constructed and passed correctly to PowerShell.

## Version 1.2 - Simplified Status Messages
- **Simplified Messages**:
  - Changed TTS announcements to "Microphone on" and "Microphone off" for clarity and simplicity.

## Version 1.3 - Added Exit Functionality
- **Exit Hotkey**:
  - Added a hotkey (`Win + Shift + Q`) to exit the script.
  - Implemented a TTS announcement ("Exiting program") before the script terminates.

## Final Version - Informative and Concise Messages
- **Startup and Exit Messages**:
  - Changed the startup TTS message to "Program started."
  - Ensured the exit TTS message was concise and informative ("Exiting program").
